### Education

---

- **Huazhong University of Science & Technology**   Sep.2018 – Jun.2021

  Master of Computer Architecture   GPA: 3.86/4 (Rank 11/55)  

- **Chang’an University**   Sep.2014 – Jun.2018  

  Bachelor of Network Engineering  GPA: 3.84/4 (Rank 1/32)  

**Technical Skills:** C/C++(4yrs), Python(2yrs), Linux, Vim, Git, Shell, GDB, CMake.  

### Work Experience

---

- **Tencent Inc., Shenzhen**,   **Jul.2019 – Present**

  ***Backend development Intern***

  - Developed a log replay-based cache model analysis system using **Python** and **C++**, can handle any cache capacity requirements on a single machine through the divide-and-conquer idea.

  - After pre-research, updated the CDN cache architecture to **RIPQ** so that advanced replacement strategies can be applied to disk sequential read and write scenarios, and **improved the cache hit rate by about 10%**, which provide ideas for the next-generation of *Tencent Cloud* CDN cache architecture.

### Projects

---

- **SSD Based Photo Cache Optimization**, *Group Research Project*,   **Sep.2018 – Mar.2019**

  - Proposed an admission policy called “one-time-access-exclusion”, filtered one-time access photos, to improve cache space utilization and reduce invalid writes to SSDs after analyzing the access of characteristics of QQ albums.
  - Used **machine learning** methods with some social information in the photos to train a classifier which could predict whether the photo is one-time-access or not, and its **accuracy is over 85%**.
  - Applied this classifier to cache with basic replacement algorithms could **improve the hit rate by about 1%~4%**,  and **the amount of data written to the SSD was significantly** **reduced about 54%**.

  > The research work has been completed and the paper is currently under review of ACM Transaction on Storage.

### Activity

---

- **Teaching assistant in HUST**,   **May – Jun.2019**

  - Worked as a TA for bachelor course “Algorithm Analysis and Design”. Mainly responsible for the preparation and teaching of experimental lessons.

  - In order to create a good experimental environment, write experimental framework code using **C++** to test and verify students’ code.

### Awards
