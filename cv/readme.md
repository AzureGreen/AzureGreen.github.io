### Work Experience

---

- **Tencent Inc., Shenzhen**,   **Jul.2019 – Present**

  ***Backend development Intern***

  - **[Static CDN Cache Model System]**
  Developed a distributed log replay-based cache model analysis system including pulling access logs in real-time, doing statistic & cache simulation tasks, and showing MRC(*Miss Ratio Curve*).  
  Most processing logic is written by **Python** coroutine, and the calculation task is written by **C++**.  
  
  - **[Deep Analysis of CDN Cache]**
  Conducted detailed analysis of the workload of different nodes from multi-tier of the CDN cache from the perspective of **recency** and **frequency**, and applied different cache **replacement strategies** (FIFO, LRU, SLRU, etc.) and **admission strategies** (LARC, BloomFilter, etc.) to test cache performance to provide the best caching strategy for different workload characteristics.


### Projects

---

- **SSD Based Photo Cache Optimization**, *Group Research Project*,   **Sep.2018 – July.2020**

  - Proposed a cache admission policy called “one-time-access-exclusion”, filtered one-time access photos, to improve cache space utilization and reduce invalid writes to SSDs after analyzing the access of characteristics of QQ albums.
  - Used **machine learning** methods with some social information in the photos to train a classifier which could predict whether the photo is one-time-access or not, and its **accuracy is over 85%**.
  - Applied this classifier to SSD cache with basic replacement algorithms could **improve the hit rate by about 2.7% to 20.9%** relatively,  and **the amount of data written to the SSD was significantly reduced about 59.7% to 87.3%** relatively.

  > The research work has been completed and the paper is published in ACM Transaction on Storage, more detail can be found in our [paper](pub/TOS1603-18.pdf).

### Activity

---

- **Teaching assistant in HUST**,   **May – Jun.2019/2020**

  - Worked as a TA for bachelor course “Algorithm Analysis and Design”. Mainly responsible for the preparation and teaching of experimental lessons.

  - In order to create a good experimental environment, write experimental framework code using **C++** to test and verify students’ code.

### Awards

---

- National Scholarship  2015
- National Inspirational Scholarship  2016/2017
- ACM 2nd prize of Chang’an University  2017
- Outstanding graduates of Chang’an University  2018.
- Outstanding thesis award of Chang’an University 2018.
